**Free Premium WorPress Plugin**

![screenshot](https://github.com/ArthurGareginyan/syntax-highlighter-for-postpage-html-editor/blob/master/assets/banner-772x250.png)

An easy to use WordPress plugin that replaces the default Post & Page HTML/Text Editor with an enhanced editor by a [CodeMirror library](https://codemirror.net/). The WordPress default Post & Page HTML/Text Editor is great for doing some custom changes to HTML markup of your post/page, although it is rather limited. This is where the "Syntax Highlighter for Post/Page HTML Editor" can help. With an enhanced HTML/Text editor you can see a code with syntax highlighting, and with line numbering, so you can easily read your HTML markup and detect any errors.

This plugin give you finer control over editor, it can be configured on the plugin settings page. You can chose from 36 different color themes for your editor. If you want more options then tell me and I will be happy to add it.

This plugin is just plug and play, no tedious configurations or hacks, just install, enable and start using your new enhanced Post/Page HTML Editor.
