Replaces the defaults WordPress Post/Page HTML Editor with an enhanced editor with syntax highlighting and line numbering.

== Description ==

An easy to use WordPress plugin that replaces the default Post & Page HTML/Text Editor with an enhanced editor by a [CodeMirror library](https://codemirror.net/). The WordPress default Post & Page HTML/Text Editor is great for doing some custom changes to HTML markup of your post/page, although it is rather limited. This is where the "Syntax Highlighter for Post/Page HTML Editor" can help. With an enhanced HTML/Text editor you can see a code with syntax highlighting, and with line numbering, so you can easily read your HTML markup and detect any errors.

This plugin give you finer control over editor, it can be configured on the plugin settings page. You can chose from 36 different color themes for your editor. If you want more options then tell me and I will be happy to add it.

This plugin is just plug and play, no tedious configurations or hacks, just install, enable and start using your new enhanced Post/Page HTML Editor.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Q. Does this plugin provide a syntax highlighting for the Theme/Plugin Editor? =
A. No, only the Post/Page HTML Editor supports. For the Theme/Plugin Editor you can use my another plugin that called the [Syntax Highlighter for WP Editor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/syntax-highlighter-for-wp-editor/).

= Q. Will this plugin work on my WordPress.COM website? =
A. Sorry, this plugin is available for use only on self-hosted (WordPress.org) websites.

= Q. Can I use this plugin on my language? =
A. Yes. But If your language is not available then you can make one. This plugin is ready for translation. The `.pot` file is included and placed in "`languages`" folder. Many of plugin users would be delighted if you shared your translation with the community. Just send the translation files (`*.po, *.mo`) to me at the arthurgareginyan@gmail.com and I will include the translation within the next plugin update.

= Q. Does this plugin require modification to the theme? =
A. Absolutely not. This plugin is added/configured entirely from the website's Admin section.

= Q. It's not working. What could be wrong? =
A. As with every plugin, it's possible that things don't work. The most common reason for this is that the plugin has a conflict with another plugin you're using. It's impossible to tell what could be wrong exactly, but if you post a support request in the plugin's support forum on WordPress.org, I'd be happy to give it a look and try to help out. Please include as much information as possible, including a link to your website where the problem can be seen.
